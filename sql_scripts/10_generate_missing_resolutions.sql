-- Dual Response Generation (RAG vs Pure-AI) for tickets with missing resolutions
-- - Uses stored embeddings from support_tickets_with_embeddings
-- - Safe cosine similarity (NULLIF denominator)
-- - Uses ml_generate_text_llm_result with FLATTEN_JSON_OUTPUT = TRUE
-- - Produces two rows per ticket: RAG-based and Pure-AI
