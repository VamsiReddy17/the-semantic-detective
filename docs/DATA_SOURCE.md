## Dataset Information

**Source**: [Kaggle - Customer Support Ticket Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/suraj520/customer-support-ticket-dataset)  
**File**: `Data/TicketData_customer_support_tickets.csv`  
**Records**: ~8,600 customer support tickets  

**Why this dataset?**  
Chosen for its *real-world complexity* and *imperfect resolutions*, which highlight the importance of AI combined with data quality awareness.

> **ðŸ“¥ Optional**: You can download the original dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/suraj520/customer-support-ticket-dataset) if you want to run this project with fresh data.

## Data Quality Notes

- **Real-world data**: Actual customer support tickets
- **Mixed quality resolutions**:  
  - *Bad*: `"Fast item someone lay because act deal hand"`  
  - *Good*: `"Reset the userâ€™s password and confirm login with MFA enabled"`  
- **Learning opportunity**: Demonstrates the critical role of data quality in AI system success

## Usage in Project

- **5,588 tickets** processed with vector embeddings  
- **2,819 open tickets** identified for AI resolution generation  
- **2,769 closed tickets** with existing resolutions used as high-quality RAG context
